# openair-tilde
A convolution reverb library for Pure Data (Pd) with the capability to switch impulse responses on the fly. This Pd external is designed to be used in interactive immersive simulation applications such as virutal reality or gaming.

When the user sends the library a request to swich impulse responses, it responds by smoothly cross-fading between the old and new convolution streams.
